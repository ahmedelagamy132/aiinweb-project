# Dispatch and Operations Procedures

## Dispatch Center Operations
The dispatch center is the operational hub coordinating drivers, customers, and management. Effective dispatch centers maintain real-time visibility of all vehicles, communicate proactively with drivers, handle customer inquiries efficiently, and adapt quickly to changing conditions.

## Order Management Workflow
Orders flow from customer systems to the warehouse for picking and staging, then to dispatch for route assignment. Priority levels determine sequence: express same-day orders first, standard deliveries second, and flexible-window deliveries last. Consolidate orders going to nearby locations when possible.

## Dynamic Route Adjustment
Pre-planned routes often require real-time adjustments due to traffic, weather, vehicle issues, or customer changes. Dispatch coordinators should monitor conditions continuously and resequence stops to minimize delays. Modern routing software can automatically suggest optimal adjustments.

## Customer Communication Standards
Professional communication builds trust and manages expectations. Contact customers 1-2 hours before arrival with specific time windows, send proactive notifications for any delays exceeding 30 minutes, confirm delivery instructions and access requirements, and respond to inquiries within 15 minutes during business hours.

## Load Planning and Staging
Efficient loading ensures easy access to items needed first (reverse chronological order of stops) and prevents damage through proper weight distribution and securing. Organize cargo by delivery sequence, separate fragile items, and document loaded items with photos when handling high-value shipments.

## Driver Check-In and Check-Out Procedures
Start-of-day procedures include vehicle inspection (tires, lights, fluids, damage check), loading verification, route review with dispatch, and mobile device setup. End-of-day includes delivery documentation submission, vehicle return and inspection, fuel status report, and issue reporting.

## Exception Handling
Common exceptions require standardized responses: delivery refusals (document reason, return to facility, notify customer), damaged cargo (photo documentation, customer signature acknowledging damage, incident report), and access issues (attempt customer contact, leave notice, reschedule delivery).

## Performance Monitoring
Monitor key operational metrics in real-time: vehicles en route vs. returned, on-time vs. late deliveries, attempted vs. completed deliveries, customer satisfaction scores, and average delivery time per stop. Use dashboards for quick status visibility.

## Shift Planning and Coverage
Ensure adequate dispatch coverage during all operating hours with overlapping shifts during peak periods (typically 7 AM - 7 PM). Maintain backup dispatcher availability for sick days and high-volume periods. Cross-train staff to handle multiple route types.

## Technology Systems Integration
Integrate dispatch software with order management, warehouse management, GPS tracking, customer communication, and financial systems. Seamless data flow reduces manual entry errors, improves response times, and enables better decision-making through comprehensive visibility.

## Peak Season Preparation
Anticipate increased volumes during peak seasons (holidays, promotions, end-of-quarter). Hire and train temporary drivers early, arrange equipment rentals in advance, extend operating hours, communicate volume expectations to customers, and establish contingency plans for demand surges.

## Safety and Security Protocols
Ensure driver safety through regular check-ins, emergency contact procedures, and secure parking location guidance. Protect cargo through manifest verification, sealed container procedures for high-value items, and GPS tracking. Report any security incidents immediately to management and authorities.
