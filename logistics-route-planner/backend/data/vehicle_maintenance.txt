# Vehicle Maintenance and Fleet Management

## Daily Vehicle Inspection Checklist
Drivers must complete pre-trip and post-trip inspections:
- Tire condition and pressure (32-35 PSI for cargo vans)
- Brake function and responsiveness
- All lights operational: headlights, brake lights, turn signals
- Mirrors adjusted and clean
- Windshield and windows clean, no cracks
- Fluid levels: oil, coolant, washer fluid, brake fluid
- Battery connections secure, no corrosion
- No visible leaks under vehicle
- Cargo area clean and organized
- Safety equipment present: first aid kit, fire extinguisher, warning triangles
- Registration and insurance documents current
- Vehicle exterior free of damage (document any new damage)

## Preventive Maintenance Schedule
Regular maintenance prevents costly breakdowns:
- Oil changes: every 5,000 km or 3 months
- Tire rotation: every 10,000 km
- Brake inspection: every 15,000 km
- Air filter replacement: every 20,000 km
- Transmission service: every 50,000 km
- Coolant flush: every 50,000 km or 2 years
- Timing belt replacement: every 100,000 km
- Battery replacement: every 3-5 years
- Spark plugs: every 50,000-100,000 km
- Suspension inspection: annually

## Fuel Efficiency Best Practices
Optimize fuel consumption to reduce operating costs:
- Maintain steady speeds, use cruise control on highways
- Avoid rapid acceleration and hard braking
- Reduce idling time (turn off engine for stops over 1 minute)
- Maintain proper tire pressure (improves MPG by 3%)
- Remove unnecessary weight from vehicle
- Use recommended grade of motor oil
- Keep engine properly tuned
- Close windows at highway speeds
- Plan routes to minimize left turns (reduces idling at lights)
- Coast to stops when safe and practical

## Vehicle Troubleshooting Guide
Common issues and immediate responses:
- **Check engine light**: note any performance changes, schedule service within 1 week
- **Low tire pressure warning**: inspect tire, inflate or report puncture
- **Overheating**: pull over safely, turn off engine, do not open radiator cap
- **Unusual noises**: document sound location and conditions, report immediately
- **Brake warning light**: reduce speed, test brakes gently, return to depot
- **Battery warning light**: minimize electrical use, drive directly to service
- **Reduced power**: likely limp mode, safe to drive slowly, schedule service
- **Transmission issues**: avoid sudden movements, return to depot immediately
- **Exhaust smoke**: white=coolant leak, blue=oil burning, black=rich fuel mixture

## Accident and Incident Reporting
Proper documentation protects drivers and company:
- Ensure safety of all parties first
- Call emergency services if injuries or major damage
- Exchange information with other parties
- Take photos of all vehicles, damage, scene context
- Collect witness contact information
- Do not admit fault or sign statements
- Complete company accident report within 24 hours
- Report to insurance within required timeframe
- Attend company safety review meeting
- Follow up on required drug/alcohol testing

## Seasonal Maintenance Considerations
Adjust maintenance for seasonal conditions:
**Winter Preparation (October-November):**
- Install winter tires or check all-weather tread depth (minimum 4mm)
- Test battery (cold weather reduces capacity)
- Check antifreeze concentration (-35°C protection)
- Inspect heating system and defrosters
- Stock winter emergency kit: blanket, shovel, sand/salt
- Verify wiper blades and winter washer fluid
- Apply rust protection treatment

**Summer Preparation (April-May):**
- Check air conditioning system
- Inspect cooling system for leaks
- Verify radiator cap holds pressure
- Check drive belts for wear
- Switch to summer washer fluid
- Inspect suspension (winter damage)
- Clean/inspect undercarriage

## Fleet Vehicle Selection
Choose appropriate vehicles for delivery operations:
**Cargo Van (1,200-1,500 kg capacity):**
- Best for: urban residential, small packages
- Pros: fuel efficient, easy parking, lower costs
- Cons: limited capacity for bulky items
- Typical MPG: 12-16

**Box Truck (3,000-4,500 kg capacity):**
- Best for: commercial deliveries, furniture, appliances
- Pros: large capacity, loading dock height
- Cons: higher fuel costs, parking challenges
- Typical MPG: 8-12

**Step Van (2,000-3,000 kg capacity):**
- Best for: high-stop density routes, package delivery
- Pros: easy entry/exit, organized shelving
- Cons: poor highway efficiency, higher initial cost
- Typical MPG: 10-13

**Refrigerated Van (1,000-1,200 kg capacity):**
- Best for: food, pharmaceuticals, perishables
- Pros: temperature control, maintains product integrity
- Cons: expensive, higher fuel consumption
- Typical MPG: 9-12

## Telematics and Fleet Tracking
Modern fleet management uses technology:
- GPS tracking for real-time vehicle location
- Diagnostic monitoring: engine codes, maintenance alerts
- Driver behavior tracking: harsh braking, speeding, idling
- Fuel consumption monitoring and reporting
- Geofencing for unauthorized vehicle use
- Route replay for training and optimization
- Automated maintenance scheduling
- Vehicle utilization analytics
- Mobile driver communication

## Cost Management
Control and reduce fleet operating expenses:
- Fuel costs: $0.15-0.25 per km (largest expense)
- Maintenance: $0.08-0.15 per km
- Insurance: $2,000-5,000 per vehicle annually
- Registration and licensing: $300-800 annually
- Depreciation: 15-25% annually for first 5 years
- Replacement cycle: 5-7 years or 200,000-300,000 km
- Total cost of ownership: $0.40-0.70 per km
- Utilization target: 85-92% of available hours

## Safety Equipment Requirements
Mandatory safety items for delivery vehicles:
- First aid kit (ANSI Type A minimum)
- Fire extinguisher (5 lb ABC rated)
- Warning triangles or flares (3 required)
- High-visibility safety vest for driver
- Flashlight with extra batteries
- Tire pressure gauge
- Basic tool kit
- Jumper cables or jump starter
- Tow strap or chain
- Ice scraper and snow brush (seasonal)

## Driver Training Requirements
Ensure drivers are qualified and trained:
- Valid commercial driver's license (if required)
- Clean driving record (no major violations within 3 years)
- DOT medical certification (for vehicles over 4,500 kg)
- Defensive driving course certification
- Vehicle-specific training for specialized equipment
- Annual refresher training on safety protocols
- Cargo securement training
- Hazmat certification (if transporting regulated materials)
- Customer service training
- Technology systems training

## Environmental Compliance
Meet environmental regulations and sustainability goals:
- Emissions testing per local regulations
- Proper disposal of oil, filters, batteries, tires
- DEF (diesel exhaust fluid) for diesel vehicles
- Spill prevention and response procedures
- Idle reduction policies (no more than 5 minutes)
- Alternative fuel vehicle options: hybrid, electric, CNG
- Route optimization to reduce miles driven
- Vehicle right-sizing to match delivery requirements
- Carbon footprint tracking and reporting
- Participation in environmental certification programs

## Vehicle Replacement Criteria
Know when to retire vehicles from the fleet:
- Age over 7-8 years
- Mileage exceeds 300,000 km
- Repair costs exceed 50% of vehicle value in single year
- Cumulative repairs exceed 75% of replacement cost
- Safety concerns cannot be economically addressed
- Reliability below acceptable standards (>3 breakdowns/year)
- Fuel efficiency significantly worse than modern equivalents
- Technology obsolescence (no telematics capability)
- Appearance detracts from professional image
- Parts availability becoming problematic
