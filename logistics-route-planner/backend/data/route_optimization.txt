# Route Optimization Best Practices

## Distance Minimization
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) forms the foundation of route optimization. Modern logistics uses approximation algorithms:
- Nearest neighbor heuristic for quick initial solutions
- 2-opt and 3-opt improvements for route refinement
- Genetic algorithms for complex multi-constraint scenarios
- Clustering approaches for large delivery networks (50+ stops)

## Time Window Management
Hard time windows require arrival within specified ranges. Soft windows allow violations with penalties:
- Schedule forward from depot departure time
- Buffer 5-10 minutes between consecutive stops
- Account for service time at each location (typically 3-8 minutes)
- Consider traffic patterns: morning (7-9 AM) and evening (4-6 PM) rush hours add 30-50% to travel time
- Late afternoon deliveries (2-5 PM) often have better success rates

## Priority-Based Routing
High-priority deliveries should be scheduled early in the route:
- Medical supplies and perishables: first 3 stops
- Standard deliveries: middle of route
- Flexible/low-priority: last stops or next-day transfer
- B2B deliveries: typically require 9 AM - 5 PM windows
- Residential: often accept 8 AM - 8 PM windows

## Vehicle Capacity Planning
Weight and volume constraints must both be satisfied:
- Standard cargo van: 1,200-1,500 kg, 10-15 m³
- Box truck: 3,000-4,500 kg, 20-40 m³
- Semi-trailer: 20,000-25,000 kg, 80-100 m³
- Build routes that reach 85-95% capacity utilization
- Account for loading sequence (last delivery loaded first)

## Geographic Clustering
Group nearby stops to minimize backtracking:
- Urban areas: 2-3 km radius clusters
- Suburban: 5-8 km radius clusters
- Rural: 10-15 km radius clusters
- Use k-means or DBSCAN for automatic clustering
- Consider natural barriers (rivers, highways, restricted zones)

## Traffic and Road Conditions
Real-time traffic integration improves ETA accuracy by 20-35%:
- Historical traffic patterns for predictive routing
- Live traffic feeds for dynamic re-routing
- Weather impact: rain adds 10-15%, snow adds 25-40% to drive time
- Road restrictions: weight limits, height clearances, hazmat routes
- School zones active 7-8 AM and 2-3 PM on weekdays

## Multi-Day Route Planning
For recurring routes, balance workload across days:
- Rotate difficult stops across different days
- Maintain consistent driver-customer relationships when possible
- Plan 5-day routes with buffer day for overflow
- Use Monday for time-flexible deliveries
- Reserve Friday for completion of week's commitments

## Return-to-Depot Timing
Plan routes ensuring drivers return before shift end:
- Add 15% buffer for unexpected delays
- Final stop should be within 45-60 min of depot
- Consider fueling time if tank below 25%
- Account for end-of-day paperwork (15-20 min)

## Technology Integration
Modern routing software provides significant advantages:
- GPS tracking for real-time position monitoring
- Mobile apps for proof of delivery and customer signatures
- Barcode scanning for package verification
- Communication tools for driver-dispatcher coordination
- Analytics dashboards for performance monitoring

## Cost Optimization
Minimize total operating costs beyond just distance:
- Fuel costs: 30-40% of route operating expenses
- Labor costs: 40-50% of operating expenses
- Vehicle maintenance: $0.08-0.15 per km
- Toll roads may be faster but add $5-20 per route
- Highway routes use 15-20% less fuel than city driving
- Idling burns 1-2 liters per hour

## Environmental Considerations
Sustainable routing reduces carbon footprint:
- Route optimization reduces CO2 by 10-25%
- Electric vehicles: range 150-400 km per charge
- Hybrid vehicles: 30-40% better fuel economy in city driving
- Eco-driving techniques save 5-15% fuel
- Consolidated deliveries reduce vehicle trips

## Performance Metrics
Track these KPIs for continuous improvement:
- On-time delivery rate (target: >95%)
- Stops per route (urban: 15-25, rural: 8-15)
- Cost per delivery (benchmark: $5-12 for urban)
- Miles per gallon (van: 10-15, truck: 6-8)
- Failed delivery rate (target: <3%)
- Customer satisfaction score (target: >4.5/5)
- Driver utilization rate (target: 85-92%)
