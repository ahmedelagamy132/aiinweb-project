# Delivery Operations Manual

## Pre-Route Preparation
Successful delivery operations start before the driver leaves the depot:
- Review route manifest: verify all stops, addresses, and special instructions

- Ensure communication devices are charged and functional
- Review weather forecast and traffic conditions
- Load necessary equipment: hand truck, straps, blankets, signature device

## Driver Safety Protocols
