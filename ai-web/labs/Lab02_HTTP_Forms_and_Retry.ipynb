    "### Step 2: Form integration\n",
    "The React form now leans on a reusable `withRetry` helper so network hiccups do not derail the student experience. The flow looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect user input in local component state.\n",
    "2. Call `withRetry` with an async function that posts the form data.\n",
    "3. Retry the call if a transient failure occurs, backing off briefly between attempts.\n",
    "4. Show a friendly message if every attempt fails, otherwise render the echoed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const sendEcho = () =>\n",
    "  withRetry(() => post('/echo', { msg }), 2, 500);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `withRetry` only depends on an async callback, you can scale the pattern across modules. For example, a profile page could share the helper from `src/lib/retry.js` and dial in its own policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const fetchProfile = () =>\n",
    "  withRetry(() => api.getProfile(userId), 3, 800);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: pass higher attempt counts and delays when hitting slower services or when layering exponential backoff (`delayMs * attempt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger forms follow the same controlled-input structure: hold each field in state, validate before submitting, and surface field-level errors next to the relevant inputs. When multiple fields need to submit together, build one payload object and reuse `withRetry` so the entire submission benefits from resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see retries in action, the backend now exposes `/flaky-echo`. Point the helper at it during testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "await withRetry(\n",
    "  () => post('/flaky-echo?failures=2', { msg }),\n",
    "  3,\n",
    "  500,\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two requests return HTTP 503 errors, the third succeeds, and the UI recovers gracefully. Wrap longer-lived retry sequences in loading spinners, keep buttons disabled until the promise settles, and consider error boundaries to catch truly fatal issues. These guardrails help the codebase grow while staying aligned with the lab’s resilient frontend architecture."
