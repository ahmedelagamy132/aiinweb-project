    "## Looking Ahead: LangChain and LangSmith for Future Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand our agent architecture with custom tools, FAISS RAG, and Gemini integration, let's explore how industry-standard frameworks like **LangChain** and **LangSmith** could enhance and streamline this workflow in future iterations of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangChain** is an open-source framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides abstractions and tools for:\n",
    "- **Chains**: Sequential operations that process inputs through multiple steps\n",
    "- **Agents**: Autonomous systems that decide which tools to use\n",
    "- **Tools**: Reusable functions that agents can call\n",
    "- **Memory**: Persistent context across multiple interactions\n",
    "- **Retrievers**: Built-in RAG and vector database integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Official website**: https://www.langchain.com/  \n",
    "**Documentation**: https://python.langchain.com/docs/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangChain Would Be Useful for Our Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Built-in RAG Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did manually:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Our custom implementation\n",
    "retriever = build_retriever(db)\n",
    "rag_contexts = retriever.search(search_query, k=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangChain:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n",
    "from langchain.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "# More powerful, standardized\n",
    "embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-004\")\n",
    "vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)\n",
    "retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 3})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Pre-built integrations** with 50+ embedding models and vector stores\n",
    "- **Standardized interfaces** that work across different providers\n",
    "- **Advanced features** like MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for diversity\n",
    "- **Easy switching** between FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Agent Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did manually:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Our custom agent orchestration\n",
    "def run_release_readiness_agent(context, db):\n",
    "    brief = fetch_feature_brief(context.feature_slug)\n",
    "    launch_window = fetch_launch_window(context.feature_slug)\n",
    "    rag_contexts = retriever.search(...)\n",
    "    gemini_insight = _generate_gemini_insight(...)\n",
    "    # ... manual orchestration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangChain:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent, AgentExecutor\n",
    "from langchain.tools import tool\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def fetch_feature_brief(feature_slug: str) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Fetch feature brief for a given feature slug.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return {...}\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool  \n",
    "def retrieve_docs(query: str) -> list[str]:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Retrieve relevant documentation using RAG.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent decides which tools to use and when\n",
    "agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools=[fetch_feature_brief, retrieve_docs])\n",
    "executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)\n",
    "result = executor.invoke({\"input\": \"Analyze release readiness for curriculum-pathways\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Autonomous decision-making**: Agent chooses which tools to call\n",
    "- **Automatic retries**: Built-in error handling and retry logic\n",
    "- **Streaming**: Stream responses in real-time\n",
    "- **Multiple agent types**: ReAct, OpenAI Functions, Structured Chat, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Prompt Templates and Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did manually:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = f\"\"\"You are a release readiness advisor...\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "{full_context}\n",
    "User's Launch Date: {context.launch_date}\n",
    "...\"\"\"\n",
    "response = model.generate_content(prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangChain:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n",
    "from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n",
    "    (\"system\", \"You are a release readiness advisor helping teams prepare for launches.\"),\n",
    "    (\"human\", \"Based on this context: {context}\\n\\nProvide analysis for launch on {launch_date}\")\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"context\": full_context, \"launch_date\": context.launch_date})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Reusable templates**: Define prompts once, use everywhere\n",
    "- **Validation**: Type-checked inputs and outputs\n",
    "- **Composition**: Chain multiple LLM calls together\n",
    "- **Few-shot examples**: Easily add example inputs/outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Memory Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we currently have:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Static: Each agent run is independent\n",
    "agent_run = AgentRun(...)\n",
    "db.add(agent_run)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangChain:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic: Agent remembers previous interactions\n",
    "memory = ConversationBufferMemory()\n",
    "chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "# First call\n",
    "chain.invoke(\"What's the launch date for curriculum-pathways?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second call remembers context\n",
    "chain.invoke(\"What are the risks?\")  # Knows we're still talking about curriculum-pathways\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Conversation tracking**: Multi-turn dialogues\n",
    "- **Context window management**: Automatic summarization\n",
    "- **Multiple memory types**: Buffer, summary, entity, vector store-backed\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LangSmith?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangSmith** is a platform for **debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring** LLM applications. Think of it as the observability layer for AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Official website**: https://www.langchain.com/langsmith  \n",
    "**Documentation**: https://docs.smith.langchain.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangSmith Would Be Critical for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Observability and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we currently have:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Limited: Just tool call traces in response\n",
    "tool_calls = [\n",
    "    AgentToolCall(tool=\"fetch_feature_brief\", ...),\n",
    "    AgentToolCall(tool=\"rag_retrieval\", ...),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example trace:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent Run (2.3s, $0.02)\n",
    "├─ fetch_feature_brief (0.1s)\n",
    "│  └─ Input: {\"feature_slug\": \"curriculum-pathways\"}\n",
    "│  └─ Output: {\"name\": \"Curriculum Pathways\", ...}\n",
    "├─ RAG retrieval (0.4s)\n",
    "│  ├─ Embedding (0.1s, 5 tokens)\n",
    "│  └─ FAISS search (0.3s)\n",
    "│  └─ Output: [3 documents]\n",
    "├─ Gemini insight (1.8s, $0.02)\n",
    "│  ├─ Prompt (234 tokens)\n",
    "│  ├─ Response (156 tokens)\n",
    "│  └─ Output: \"Strategic launch assessment...\"\n",
    "└─ Result assembled (0.0s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Dataset Management and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we currently lack:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manual testing, no test suite\n",
    "# Have to run agent manually to verify behavior\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangSmith:**\n",

    "        {\"feature_slug\": \"ai-code-review\", \"launch_date\": \"2025-04-15\"},\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    outputs=[\n",
    "        {\"expected_recommendations\": [\"Confirm launch communications\", ...]},\n",
    "        {\"expected_recommendations\": [\"Validate operational readiness\", ...]},\n",

    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run evaluation\n",
    "results = client.run_on_dataset(\n",
    "    dataset_name=\"release_readiness_tests\",\n",
    "    llm_or_chain=agent_chain,\n",
    "    evaluation=custom_evaluator\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Regression testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing behavior\n",
    "- **A/B testing**: Compare different prompts or models\n",
    "- **Ground truth comparison**: Measure accuracy against expected outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Prompt Iteration and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we currently do:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manual: Edit prompt string, redeploy, test manually\n",
    "prompt = f\"You are a release readiness advisor...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangSmith:**\n",
    "- **Prompt playground**: Test prompts interactively\n",
    "- **Version control**: Track prompt changes over time\n",
    "- **Comparison view**: See outputs side-by-side\n",
    "- **Automatic optimization**: Find best-performing prompt variants\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Production Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we currently have:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic: Save runs to database\n",
    "agent_run = AgentRun(...)\n",
    "db.add(agent_run)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With LangSmith:**\n",
    "- **Real-time dashboards**: Monitor agent performance live\n",
    "- **Alerting**: Get notified of errors or anomalies\n",
    "- **Cost tracking**: See token usage and costs per endpoint\n",
    "- **User feedback**: Collect thumbs up/down from users\n",
    "- **Automated analysis**: Identify patterns in failures\n",
